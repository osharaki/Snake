## Running the game
### Windows
If you're on Windows, simply download and run <b>snake_installer.msi</b>. This will install the game at a destination of your choice.

### Other platforms
If you're running the game on a platform other than Windows, or if you simply don't want to install the game, you'll need to have a local installation of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and additionally install [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation). Then from the command line you can run:
```
python canvas.py
```
